This avoids polluting browser markup with inline styles, provides clear abstractions for reasoning about components, and allows for style reuse.\n\")\n\n\n(defcard-doc \"\n  ## Creating Styles\n\n  It's helpful to distinguish style definitions from other types of definitions. Append `-style` to the name of your component when defining the style: `(def blocks-style)`, `(page-style)`.\n\n  Stylefy Styles are written as Clojure maps, so they should look familiar\n\n  ```clojure\n  (def button-style\n    {:cursor \\\"pointer\\\"\n     :padding \\\"6px 10px\\\"})\n  ```\n\")\n\n\n(defcard-doc \"\n  Style pseudo-elements and element modes with `::stylefy/mode` inside the style definition.\n\n  ```clojure\n  (def button-style\n    {:cursor \\\"pointer\\\"\n      :padding \\\"6px 10px\\\"\n      ::stylefy/mode [[:hover {:background-color \\\"blue\\\"}]\n                      [:after {:content \\\"''\\\"}]]})\n  ```\n\")\n\n\n(defcard-doc \"\n  Create styles for inner components with Stylefy's \\\"sub-styles\\\". Use these when creating sub-components that won't be used separately.\n\n  ```clojure\n  (def left-sidebar-style\n    {:display \\\"flex\\\"\n     ::stylefy/sub-styles {:footer {:margin-top \\\"auto\\\"}}})\n  ```\n\")\n\n\n(defcard-doc \"\n  Create deeper selections with `::stylefy/manual`.\n\n  ```clojure\n  (def block-indicator-style\n    {:width \\\"12px\\\"\n     :height \\\"32px\\\"\n     ::stylefy/manual [[:&.open {:color \\\"blue\\\"}]})\n  ```\n\")\n\n\n(defcard-doc \"\n  Create more complex selections where necessary by combining manual mode with [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden)'s advanced selectors.\n\n  ```clojure\n  (:require [garden.selectors :as selector])\n\n  (def block-indicator-style\n    {:width \\\"12px\\\"\n     :height \\\"32px\\\"\n     ::stylefy/mode [[:before {:content \\\"'hello'\\\"}]]\n     ::stylefy/manual [[:&.closed [(selectors/& (selectors/before)) {:content \\\"none\\\"}]]})\n  ```\n\n  Check out Stylefy's [documentation](https://github.com/Jarzka/stylefy) to learn about composing styles together, creating dynamic style functions, and more.\n\")\n\n\n(defcard-doc \"\n  ### Applying Styles\n\n  Connect your new style with the component with Stylefy's `(use-style)` function. `(use-style)` accepts two arguments: the style to add, and attributes to apply to the component.\n\n  ```clojure\n  (:require [stylefy.core :as stylefy :refer [use-style]])\n\n  (def box-style\n    {:border \\\"1px solid\\\"})\n\n  (defn box-component\n    [:div (use-style box-style)])\n  ```\")\n\n\n(defcard-doc \"\n  Provide attributes to the element by adding them to `(use-style)` after the style.\n\n  ```clojure\n  [:a (use-style link-style {:href \\\"https://athensresearch.github.io/athens\\\"} \\\"Athens\\\")]\n  ```\n\")\n\n\n(defcard-doc \"\n  Apply sub-styles with Stylefy's `(use-sub-style)` function.\n              \n  Don't create empty sub-styles, as this may silently break Stylefy processing.\n\n  ```clojure\n  (:require [stylefy.core :as stylefy :refer [use-style]])\n\n  (def box-style {:border \\\"1px solid\\\"\n                  ::stylefy/sub-styles {:box-child {:background \\\"blue\\\"}})\n\n  (defn box-component\n    [:div (use-style box-style)\n      [:div (use-sub-style box-style :box-child)]])\n  ```\n  \")\n\n\n(defcard-doc \"\n  Avoid creating styles that will be frequently updated, because this forces Stylefy to create a new class for each update.\n  \n  In these cases, merge `use-style` with a style attribute to perform the updates inline, bypassing `use-style`.\n  \n  ```clojure\n  [:div (merge (use-style cursor-trail-style) {:style {:left x :top y}})]\n  ```\")\n"]}
